# HCAPHS-ANALYSIS
For the Maven Healthcare Challenge, you'll be working as a Data Analyst for the American Hospital Association (AHA), a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients, and acts as a source of information on health care issues and trends.

As part of your role, you've been asked to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years. The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its 3 main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care".
